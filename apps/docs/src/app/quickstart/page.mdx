# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the ArkProject API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the ArkProject API, you will need to grab your
  API key [from your dashboard](/authentication#creating-an-api-key).
</Note>

## Making your first API request

Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the NFT Contract endpoint to get a list of all nft contracts.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/contracts">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.arkproject.dev/v1/contracts \
  -H "x-api-key: <INSERT_API_KEY_HERE>"
```

</CodeGroup>

<div>
  <Button
    href="/nft-contracts"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the NFT Contracts endpoint"
  />
</div>

## What's next?
