# Authentication

API Key authentication is a simple and effective way to authenticate requests to an API. To use API Key authentication, you will need to create an API Key for your project.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API Key, you must first sign in and create a project in the dashboard. Once you have created a project, you can access your API Key.

To create an API Key, follow these steps:

- Log in and access to the [dashboard](https://www.arkproject.dev/dashboard).
- Create a new project. You will be prompted to provide a name and a description for your project.
- Once you have created your project, you will able to copy/paste your API Key on the project page.

## Using API Key Authentication

To use API Key authentication, you must include the `x-api-key` header in your request. For example, the following request uses API Key authentication:

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
 curl https://api.arkproject.dev/v1/contracts \
   -H "x-api-key: <INSERT_API_KEY_HERE>"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
