# Getting Started

## Overview

The ArkProject React SDK provides React components and hooks to interact with arkchain seamlessly in your React or Next.js applications.

## Installation

To get started, install the `@ark-project/react` package:

```bash
pnpm add @ark-project/react
```

## Creating the Starknet Provider

Before using the `ArkProvider`, you need to create a Starknet provider. For detailed instructions on setting this up, refer to the Starknet React documentation: [Create Starknet Provider](https://starknet-react.com/docs/getting-started).

## React/Next.js Application Setup with Starknet Provider

Integrate the ArkProvider and StarknetProvider into your application like so:

```jsx
import { StarknetProvider } from '@/components/starknet-provider' // Ensure you have a StarknetProvider component
import { networks } from '@ark-project/core'
import { ArkProvider } from '@ark-project/react'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  const config = {
    starknetNetwork: networks.mainnet,
    arkchainNetwork: networks.mainnet,
  }

  return (
    <StarknetProvider>
      <ArkProvider config={config}>
        {/* Rest of your application components */}
        {children}
      </ArkProvider>
    </StarknetProvider>
  )
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that your ArkProvider is set up, you can use the various hooks and components provided by the SDK to build your application.
