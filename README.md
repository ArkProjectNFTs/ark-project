# ark-rs

## Overview
Rust library related to the ArkProject.

This library aims at providing the building block
and functionalities for the Starknet community in
order to work with NFTs.

## Architecture

The indexation of NFTs is at the moment a challenge on Starknet
due to the standards being in progress.

To propose a flexible and evolutive approach, `ark-rs` provides
the following crates:

1. Storage

By defining generic interface for the storage, we reduce the coupling
between backend implementation and indexer requirements.
To run, the indexer only needs an implementation of `StorageManager` to
access/store NFTs data.

This is what `storage` crate provides. You can find a basic storage implementation based on SQL-Lite,
but you may write your own by simply implementing `StorageManager` trait.

2. Indexer

The index logic is usually the same for all NFTs. Gathering the events first,
to then identify the contract and tokens associated to the event.
The `indexer` crate provide a `main_loop` with this logic, for an efficient
indexation per blocks.

3. Metadata

Even if the metadata are not at the core of the indexing process, they are
vital for any NFT ecosystem.
The `metadata` crate aims at providing basic functions to work with normalized metadata.
In the current design, this crate totally separated from the indexation loop as it can be massively optimized elsewhere.

4. Starknet

To work, the indexer interacts with Starknet. The `starknet` crate provides
an epurated Starknet provider interface to get the job done.

## Features

- Indexer logic for Starknet NFT
- Indexer for arkchain orderbook
- Generic storage for indexer data with SQL-lite
- NFT Metadata manager interface

## Quick start

Examples are available in the `example` folder.
They can be run with the following command:
```
RUST_LOG="ark=trace,storage=trace" cargo run --example nft_indexer
```

To work on a specific package:
```
cargo build -p <package>
```
