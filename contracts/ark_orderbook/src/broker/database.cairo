//! Orders database.
//!
//! The order database uses the `storage_read` and `storage_write`
//! syscalls directly to optimize how data are stored.
//!
//! The status is always stored independently of the seriliazed
//! broker. This allows a quick and cheap storage/retrieval of the status
//! without having to write/read the whole order.
//!
//! The only assumption for now is that,
//! a single order serialized buffer must not exceed
//! 256 felts.
//!
//! The storage layout is the following:
//!
//! 1. Compute the storage base address with [BROKER_DB_BASE_KEY, broker_id]
//! 2. At base address => The broker whitelisting status.
